# MapView
Stitching each tile of F-7 Sector of Islamabad, gotten from Google Earth Images Downloader, to get a bigger picture. The `isloStudy.py` file first joins the image tiles horizontally and save them to the folder `me_horozontal`. Then, it takes all saved images from `me_horizontal` and stack them up over to each other to get a complete full screen view.
